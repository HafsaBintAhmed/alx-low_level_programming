You can find the source code here
The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program
You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, and RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
The output of the program should be:
The string Last digit of, followed by
n, followed by
the string is, followed by
if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
followed by a new line
