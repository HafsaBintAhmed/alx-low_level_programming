The given task involves working with file input/output operations in the C programming language. The first three tasks involve creating C functions that perform specific file operations.

In the first task, a function is created that reads a text file and prints it to the standard output. The number of letters to be read and printed is specified as a parameter. If the file cannot be opened or read, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the actual number of bytes it reads and prints.

In the second task, a function is created that creates a file with the specified name and writes the specified text content to it. If the text content is NULL, an empty file is created. If the file already exists, its permissions are not changed. The created file has permissions rw-------. If the function fails, it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns 1.

In the third task, a function is created that appends text to the end of a file with the specified name. If the file does not exist, it is not created. If the text content is NULL, nothing is added to the file. If the function fails, it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns 1.

The fourth task is a C program that copies the contents of one file to another. The first argument is the file to be copied, and the second argument is the name of the copy to be created. If the copy already exists, it is truncated. The created file has permissions rw-rw-r--. If the number of arguments is incorrect or the file cannot be read or written to, the program prints an error message and exits with the appropriate status code.

The final task is a C program that displays the information contained in the ELF header of an ELF file. The program takes the name of the ELF file as an argument and displays various pieces of information about the file, such as its magic number, class, data format, version, and entry point address. If an error occurs or the file is not an ELF file, an error message is printed to stderr and the program exits with a status code of 98.
